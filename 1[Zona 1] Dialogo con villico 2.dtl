"Villico 2": My cousin's brother's nephew went missing the other day. I am very worried.
- When was the last time you have seen him?
	"Villico 2": He was playing in the park near the border of the woods.
- Maybe he's playing hide and seek!
	"Villico 2": Yeah, probably, he's the regional champion after all!
