GrimBalduzzi: Hi, things are really bad with my mind...
GrimBalduzzi: I made a huge mistake abruptly stopping five psychiatric drugs.
GrimBalduzzi: You can't imagine how raw I am.
GrimBalduzzi: I'm telling you this calmly and serenely.
GrimBalduzzi: I'm often sedated...
GrimBalduzzi: I stopped taking psychiatric drugs, and I don't know if someone I was taking can interact with new people.
GrimBalduzzi: I don't think so...
GrimBalduzzi: I know it would be nice to heal, but unfortunately, I don't even know how to be independent and autonomous, especially going alone, for example, in my area.
