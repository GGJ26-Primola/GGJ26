Mazapégul: You! Hey You! You made it this far, you're not the average guy, that's for sure!
Player: It's you again! You have to tell me who you were referring to!
Mazapégul: Oh yeah, "her". She's evil incarnate, a force of destruction indeed. Look around you, cant you feel it?
Mazapégul: The ugly tingle of dark magic in the air? This place is permeated with the power of an evil witch!
Mazapégul: The dead rise from the ground and roam the earth. You are very lucky - or very special - to have befriended the Gatto Mammone.
Mazapégul: The power of his mask will allow you to see the twisted spirits that will hunt you, but i don't think your umarellitude can help you here.
Player: Why not?
Mazapégul: Because those are ghosts, you PATACCA! Wave a stick at them, see what happens! They will laugh at you before eating you for breakfast!
Mazapégul: Speaking of, i think it's time to go steal my third breakfast of the day, being me is very tiring and i need replenishment! See you soon!
Player: Hey wait-...he already left.
